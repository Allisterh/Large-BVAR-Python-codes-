Large Bayesian VAR of the US Economy authored by Richard Crump, Stefano Eusepi, Eric Qian, and Argia Sbordone

Overview
This repository contains the Python implementation of a large Bayesian VAR (BVAR) model. The python script contains functions that I translated from the original MATLAB functions.

Functions
The large_bvar.py file includes several functions that implement different components of the BVAR model from reading the data, transforming and fitting the model to constructing and plotting forecasts and scenario analyses. 
The code is in the preliminary testing stage, and most of the functions are working as expected. I am still validating, optimizing, and debugging certain parts of large functions, and will update the repository as I progress.

Reference
I translated the codes based on the following paper:

Crump, Richard K., Stefano Eusepi, Domenico Giannone, Eric Qian, and Argia M. Sbordone. “A Large Bayesian VAR of the United States Economy.” SSRN Electronic Journal, 2021. https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3908154.

Usage
Please refer to the individual function docstrings within the large_bvar.py file for details on how to use each function, including input parameters and return values.

Contributing
I welcome Contributions to further improve and test the code. Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. You may contact me for inquires at joshi27s@uw.edu.
